# Ames Housing Project Predictor
## Overview
Welcome to the Ames Housing Project Predictor! This data science project aims to predict housing prices in Ames, Iowa, using various features and historical data. The goal is to provide accurate predictions for housing prices based on numerous factors such as the size of the house, the number of rooms, and other relevant features.

# Project Structure
data/: Contains raw data files and any intermediate datasets.

train.csv: Training dataset with housing information.
test.csv: Test dataset for making predictions.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, and evaluation.

EDA.ipynb: Notebook for initial data exploration and cleaning.
model_building.ipynb: Notebook for developing and tuning predictive models.
submission.ipynb: Notebook for preparing and saving the final submission.
src/: Source code directory with Python scripts and functions.

data_preprocessing.py: Scripts for data cleaning and preprocessing.
feature_engineering.py: Scripts for creating and selecting features.
model.py: Contains model definitions and training functions.
utils.py: Utility functions used throughout the project.
requirements.txt: List of Python packages required for the project.



# Getting Started
Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3.8+ and the necessary packages installed. You can install the required packages using:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Data Preparation
Download the datasets (train.csv and test.csv) and place them in the data/ directory.

Run the data_preprocessing.py script to clean and preprocess the data:

bash
Copy code
python src/data_preprocessing.py
Exploratory Data Analysis
Open the notebooks/EDA.ipynb notebook to explore the dataset and understand the features.
Model Building
Use the notebooks/model_building.ipynb notebook to experiment with different models and tune their parameters.

Save the best model and its parameters for predictions.

# Making Predictions
Prepare your final model in the notebooks/submission.ipynb notebook.

Generate predictions for the test.csv dataset and prepare the submission file.

# Running the Code
To run the complete pipeline, execute the following commands in sequence:

bash
Copy code
python src/data_preprocessing.py
jupyter notebook notebooks/EDA.ipynb
jupyter notebook notebooks/model_building.ipynb
jupyter notebook notebooks/submission.ipynb
